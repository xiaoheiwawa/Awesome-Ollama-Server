# or
yarn start
```

## Usage Instructions

### Detect Services

1. Click the "Service Detection" button
2. Enter Ollama service addresses in the pop-up dialog (one per line)
3. Click "Start Detection"
4. Wait for the detection to complete and view the results
5. Option to download detection results

### Filter and Sort

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and set the following variables. Github Actions will automatically execute monitoring and upload after filling in.

```env
# Optional: Redis Configuration (if used)
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your-redis-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your-redis-token

# Optional: FOFA scanning country list (if used)
COUNTRYS=US,CN,RU
```

## Docker Deployment

This project supports Docker deployment for easy setup in various environments.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vincexiv/ollama-monitor-service.git
   cd ollama-monitor-service
   ```

3. Create an environment variables file (if you need Upstash Redis for data storage)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit the `.env` file and fill in your Upstash Redis credentials:
   ```
   UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
   UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your_redis_token
   ```

4. Start the services
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start two services:
   - `ollama-monitor`: Web application, accessible at http://localhost:3000
   - `monitor-service`: Background monitoring service that automatically collects Ollama service data

### Using Docker Only

If you only need to deploy the web application without the background monitoring service:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t ollama-monitor .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name ollama-monitor \
  -e UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url \
  -e UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN=your_redis_token \
  ollama-monitor
```

Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
